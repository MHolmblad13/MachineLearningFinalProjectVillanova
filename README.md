# MachineLearningFinalProjectVillanova
The goal of this project is to create a method to predict the League of Legends world's bracket using machine learning techniques.


This project is completed. The paper scored an 82/100 and the presentation scored a 90/100. The presentation has the final results of the project presented. This project will be known as version 1 of the LoLEsportsPredictor repo. The main thing that came out of this project is my equation to predict the knockout stage perfectly or near perfectly.


The csv files came from OraclesElixir http://oracleselixir.com/about/ and without their work. This project wouldn't have gotten as far as it did.
